        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>We respect your personal data. That’s why we’ve created a straightforward Privacy Policy explaining what information we collect when you use PlayAI application or communicate with us by any means (including email, phone, messengers, and more). The Privacy Policy reveals how you control the collected information, how we use this data, and how to contact us. It also describes what measures we take to protect your data like the rules requested by General Data Protection Regulation (<a href="https://gdpr.eu/">GDPR</a>).</p>
<h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
<p>We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would be the data processor.
Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to ensure your access and use of the Mobile Application and Services. In such instances, we are a data controller because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information.</p>
<p>We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, which is processed only per your instructions. In such instances, the User providing Personal Information acts as a data controller.</p>
<p>In order to make the Mobile Application and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used to help us run and operate the Mobile Application and Services.</p>
<p>Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Mobile Application and Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.
Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular, whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
<h2>What information is processed automatically?</h2>
<p>On the basis of your permission we use third-party automatic data processing technologies (advertising or analytics tools) to analyze certain information sent by your device via our App (Identity For Advertisers). Some integrated advertising or analytics tools launch automated processing of your personal data, including profiling, which means any form of automated processing of personal data used to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to you, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning your personal preferences, interests, behavior, location or movements (see the list of data described below). Processing information through automatic data processing technologies starts automatically once you allow our Mobile Application to track your activity. You can withdraw your permission at any time. </p>
<p>We may process some information about your device and your user behavior on the ground of our legitimate interest. It is generally non-personal, i.e. it does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual, and we may access it only in aggregated form. We use this information for improving our App and giving our users the best experience.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Device Details</b>. When you use a mobile device to access our App, some of the details about your device are reported, including “device identifiers”. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device (but not your personality). Device identifier enables generalized reporting or personalized content and ads by the third parties.</li>
<li><b>What data can be processed:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Information about the device itself: type of your device, type of operating system and its version, model and manufacturer, screen size, screen density, orientation, audio volume and battery, battery life, loading time, latency, framerate, device memory usage.</li>
        <li>Information about the Internet connection: mobile carrier, network provider, network type, IP address, timestamp and duration of sessions, speed, browser.</li>
        <li>Location-related information: IP address, the country code/ region/ state/ city associated with your SIM card or your device, language setting, time zone, neighboring commercial points of interest (eg. “coffee shop”).</li>
        <li>Other device identifiers: user identifiers. </li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li><b>Information about the applications</b>. Name, API key (identifier for application), version, properties of our App can be reported for automated processing and analysis. Some services also record the list of applications and/or processes which are installed or run on your device.</li>
<li><b>Cookies and similar technologies</b>. When you use the App, cookies and similar technologies may be used (pixels, web beacons, scripts). A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information which is downloaded to your device when you access the App. The text file is then sent back to the server each time you use the App. This enables us to operate the App more effectively. For example, we will know how many users access specific areas or features within our App and which links or ads they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our App is used, improve our marketing efforts, and provide content and features that are of interest to you. We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to the App, which may use cookies or similar technologies.</li>
<li><b>Log file information</b>. Log file information is automatically reported each time you make a request to access the App. It can also be provided when the App is installed on your device. When you use our App, analytics tools automatically record certain log file information, including time and date when you start and stop using the App, and how you interact with the App.</li>
<li><b>Ad-related information</b>. The following data might be reported about the ads you can view: the date and time a particular ad is served; a record if that ad was “clicked” or if it was shown as a “conversion” event; what the ad offer is about; what type of ad it is (e.g., text, image, or video); which ad placement is involved (where the ad offer is displayed within the App); whether you respond to the ad.</li>
<li><b>In-App events</b>. When you use our App, analytics tools automatically record in-App information (tutorial steps, leveling up, payments, in-app purchases, custom events, progression events, method of limiting the processing of user data).</li>
<li><b>Payment Information</b>. Our e-commerce provider (Apple) is responsible for billing, processing and charging for in-app purchases, handles your personal information and keeps it absolutely safe and secure. This information is processed as part of the performance of the contract between you and us. We cannot access or use your credit or debit card information. You may access the applicable “in-app” purchase rules and policies directly from the App Store.</li>
</ul>
<p>Information provided automatically to advertising or analytics tools does not generally come to our control, therefore we cannot be responsible for processing such information. Please mind that some services are engaged in personal data profiling and may obtain information related to your personality and/or your device by using technologies that do not belong to our scope of responsibility. </p>

<p>In order to deliver our services your details may need to be shared with one or more of the following data processors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/">Apple</a> to process purchases through the iTunes App Store.</li>
<li><a href="https://openai.com/privacy/">OpenAI</a> as AI-generated content provider. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/legal/services-privacy-policy/">Appsflyer</a> as an analytics services provider. </li>
<li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy?hl=ru">Firebase</a> to track crashes and app performance.</li>
<li><a href="https://qonversion.io/privacy/#:~:text=We%20will%20never%20share%20your,upload%20to%20the%20Qonversion%20Service.">Qonversion</a> as a service for in-app purchases analysis. </li>
</ul>

<p>By accepting our privacy policy you acknowledge that the information you provide may be transferred to these data processors for processing in accordance with their respective privacy policies and terms. At all times we strive to share the minimum amount of personal information necessary.</p>
<p>We may release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our Website policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable user/visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
<p>Finally, in the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</p>
<h2>Disclosure of information</h2>
<p>Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any Service you have requested, we may share your information with our affiliates, contracted companies, and service providers (collectively, “Service Providers”) we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Mobile Application and Services available to you and whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. We will not share any personally identifiable information with third parties and will not share any information with unaffiliated third parties.
Service Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Service Providers are given the information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose any of the provided information for their own marketing or other purposes.</p>
<h2>Retention of information</h2>
<p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>
<h2>Social media features</h2>
<p>Our Mobile Application and Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook and Twitter buttons, Share This buttons, etc (collectively, “Social Media Features”). These Social Media Features may collect your IP address, and what page you are visiting on our Mobile Application and Services, and may set a cookie to enable Social Media Features to function properly. Social Media Features are hosted either by their respective providers or directly on our Mobile Application and Services. Your interactions with these Social Media Features are governed by the privacy policy of their respective providers.</p>
<h2>Links to other resources</h2>
<p>The Mobile Application and Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Mobile Application and Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect Personal Information.</p>
<h2>Privacy of children</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us through the Mobile Application and Services, please contact us to request that we delete that child’s Personal Information from our Services.</p>
<p>We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through Mobile Applications and Services without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information when online without their permission.</p>
<h2>Information security</h2>
<p>We secure the information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in our control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and the Mobile Application and Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.</p>
<h2>Data breach</h2>
<p>In the event, we become aware that the security of the Mobile Application and Services has been compromised or Users’ Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the User as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will post a notice in the Mobile Application.</p>
